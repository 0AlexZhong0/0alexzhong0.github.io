First and foremost, I want to thank all those people who have provided me support and guidance along the way, no matter how small or big; I want to appreciate you guys sincerely with all my hearts.

In this post, I will talk about the takeaway lessons first; then, I will summarise the mistakes that I have made. I hope this post will give some tips to those who are still applying for roles or that are seeking specific advice to improve themselves in the job application process.

# Luck plays a role

I have to admit, it has been extraordinarily fortunate and luckily for me to even have those X initial online challenges, Y phone interviews and three offers. Because I applied to companies like Microsoft twice in the same year, and I could not pass the initial CV rounds. However, I got to the phone interview stage with Google, which I thought I did well, but unfortunately, they were not allowed to give me feedback. Towards the end of October, when almost all companies have finished recruiting, including the ones I like the most. I was about to give up. Then through some tremendous will, I forced myself to send out two more applications where at the end I got offers from both of them. Then on the same day, a startup founder also reached out wanting to recruit me.

I went from no offers between March to October, to having three offers in ONE week. If I say, there is no luck involved, and it is all about hard work, I am lying, and I will not believe it myself. Every application you sent out will have some uncontrollable factors such as the mood of the recruiter or interviewer, the strengths and capability of other candidates, the financial situation of the company and many different reasons. Since we have zero control over these things, we must focus on the things that we can deliberately act to change and improve, such as the things I will mention below.

# Connection matters

## Why does it matter?

When everyone has a good grade, concrete side projects and decent work experience and almost the same resume structure and layout, what then may set the candidates apart? I have received from my mentors, who are venture capitalists. Dozen of my friends who work in companies like Microsoft, Google, Atlassian, Xero and Delloite, etc. suggested if you have a good connection with someone influential in the hiring decisions (with the likes of the hiring manager, the interviewers or even an executive manager). You will have a higher likelihood of success than those who don't.

Knowing someone in the company is good, but it matters a lot who you know. If your goal is to get hired as a software engineer in the company, then having a connection with a person in the contact centre probably doesn't help much. That's why it is essential to have relationships with people who can impact hiring decisions, and there are many reasons why it can help you significantly in the hiring process.

## How can I make these connections?

If you are still in the university, congratulations, it is the perfect place to make life-long friends whom you can share your deepest secrets with. There are numerous ways to meet incredible people, and here are a few:

1. From your classes: this one seems obvious, but I have not realised it until 2020 finishes. During the year of pandemic, all lectures and tutorials were virtual, so I did not meet anyone from my classes. I think back to 2019; I can comfortably say I knew more than half of my mates whom I hang out from my classes. I found forming a study group, where you can offer and receive help or working on assignments together, are few of the best ways to break the ice.

2. From clubs/events: from here, you can meet a countless number of people of your similar interests. Because you already have a common topic to discuss beforehand, it should be easier to spark up conversations and keep it rolling from there.

3. From school accommodations: in the first-year accommodations, because no one knew anyone at all. You are forced to mix and mingle with others. Although it is uncomfortable at first, after you broke the ice, there is a high likelihood that they will become your closet friends for years to come. This is exactly my experience!

## Give, then you shall receive

You must not see the people you meet or the friends you make as someone who you can benefit or get value from in the future. Instead, you want to make friends with them because you find them genuinely intriguing and you guys have things in common to share and talk about. Of course, it is okay to ask your friends for help, but I am suggesting you should not see that as the sole purpose of your connections. You should be willing to give, offer values and help others as well.

# Resume, show the best of yourself

Writing a good CV is a topic where many have written amazing contents on. My great friend Sukhans, who interned in Microsoft Headquarter wrote a brilliant [article](https://sukhans.com/goodcv/) on how to write a great CV. The article is his anecdotal view based on his experience of getting interviews with startups and Big-N/FANG. His tips greatly influenced my resume layout, format and content. Here is a brief summary of what he talked about:

- **The content** to include in the resume: the list follows in the order of importance, Work Experience -> Personal Projects (Potentially tied with #1) -> Extra-Curriculars -> GPA.

- **Focus on the impact**: don't only write what you did, instead, write about how and why you did it. This is important because it gives people a more clear idea of your technical capabilities and how well you have worked within a team or how much you have improved the product.

- **Final tips**: use a proper template; get others to review the resume regularly; make your points clear and concise.

# Patience

Every failure leads to another success. A 100% success rate in job applications is an unrealistic goal; you have to expect failures along the way. You have declared surrender if you give up now. I would not have gotten the two offers I had if I didn't send out my applications despite the hopelessness and desperations. However, it is crucial to act on the failures, and this leads to my next point.

## Evaluate and act

Often, if you did not pass the resume screening round, then you will likely not get any feedback from the company other than a thank-you letter or worse, you don't hear back from them. It is challenging to act under those circumstances because we don't know what we have done wrong.

Other times, if you have done a phone or an in-person interview, but failed, unfortunately, then it will be beneficial to ask for feedback during the interview, you cannot ask the interviewer how they think you performed. Instead, you should ask them anything that you were not sure and check if you had a right answer for that. And was it not successful, then after the interview, ask the relevant people what you did not do well, what made you fell short and what you can improve?

In rare times, for whatever reasons, the company refuses to give any feedback. Then you can ask your friends and family how they have passed their interviews and what set them apart from their peers throughout the recruitment process. Then you compare their advice with your current approach. With a grain of salt, change things that contradict the success stories you have heard from other people and keep the things that work or make it even better. It is even better if you do this in the very beginning of the job search process so it can prepare you well and maximise the likelihood of your success.ess so it can prepare you well and maximise the likelihood of your success.

## The daily 1% improvement

Consistency pays off. The only person that you should compare with is - you from yesterday. I am proud of the fact that after two years of continuous learning, I went from not knowing how to write a single line of code, to be able to write a full-stack web application with unit, integration, end to end and UI tests integrated into a CI/CD pipeline.

It was very slow to pick things up at the start for me because for every aspect of the app; there is a different technology to learn. So the scope and amount of learning aggregate significantly over time. However, consider this fact, a 1% improvement each day for a year makes you become almost 38 times (<img style="display:inline;" src="../../static/media/one_perc_improvement.gif"></img>) better than where you started. That is why focusing on small incremental daily improvements is so important. You will only see frustrations if you expect instant gratifications or if you want to see results fast. Sure, the speed of learning is different for everyone, but I believe the tortoise can always outrun the hare. Consistency matters.

Here is my example. I did not learn `React` in 1 week, two weeks or a month. It took me about 3 to 6 months to properly understand the main concepts such as [state and lifecycle](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html), [JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html) and [components and props](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html) etc. By understand, I mean I am able to identify these concepts given other people's code and to organise and use the concepts correctly in my own projects. In the official [React docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/), they have only listed twelve main concepts as of November 2020. Therefore, just like most people, I was expecting results fast, I want to be able to write a full-blown app in a week. I did build some components in a matter of days, but I did not understand the concepts, I was really just copying and pasting. I will not understand any of my code shortly after a few days. Then I became frustrated, for not be able to learn and understand quickly. But after some self-reflection, and discussing with others, I realised it is very challenging to learn a tough concept and be able to implement it in a very short amount of time, so I paced myself. I took one bite at a time. I spent about one to four weeks playing around with state and lifecycles. Another week or two getting used to the JSX syntax to build components. Finally, I gathered and integrated all the knowledge I had learnt into an application. It was a slow and long ride, but the outcome is satisfactory, and of course, there were tough times, roadblocks and setbacks, but those obstacles were what made me cherish and grateful for the results.

# My mistakes in the job application process

- **I did not tailor my resume for the role I am applying for**: I used the same resume for every company I applied for. The downfall of that is I missed addressing the key skills, attributes and characteristics that the company is looking for. The company and you will commit to each other for at least three months if you are employed, it makes sense to spend an hour or two to polish up your resume before you click "Apply".
- ** Lack of self-reflection**: while it was great that I put in the action to get started and kept going, but when I failed along the way, I took it for granted, and I did not put in the initiatives to reflect on why I failed, how I can make a change and seek success stories and advice from others. This Lack of action was negative reinforcement, and it made failures almost inevitable because I failed to prepare, change and improve along the way.
- **Too much individualism**: ties in with the last point, most people did not succeed on their own, they had peers. I was trying to do everything on my own; I did not know how others have done it successfully. I repeated other people's failures.
- **Too shy to ask for help**: Although I did ask for referrals from my really close friends, it is after I failed at those companies, I did not reach out to anybody else. I knew a few people at some great companies I wanted to work in, had I gone to talk to them and ask them for referrals; I could probably at least get a chance to interview with those companies.

# My self-development plan

## Open-source contributions

I want to contribute to an open-source project because it is a great way to work on large-scale projects. It allows you to communicate with maintainers, contributors and other users of the project like yourself and to understand an existing large codebase. I have always wanted to work on large-scale projects and to get involved in an open-source project is a perfect way to do it.

I created my first PR and issue in mid-October in Atlassian's `gostatsd`, and I got more interested in it the more I look into its codebase. It exposed me to different coding styles, concepts such as API context, streams, and drastically improve my ability to explore and understand an existing codebase which I believe is a vital skill for when you are onboarding to a new team. I am enjoying the process of getting involved in the open-source community, and I urge you to do so, too because it's fun, educational, and you have the potential to reach and help thousands of other people.

## Technical skill improvements

(Reinvent the wheels, be it a framework, components or technologies. Explain why building from the ground up is beneficial)

I believe you have heard this a million times, the best way to learn is by doing, and it cannot be more true in the world of software. My problem was I did not what sort of projects I should build, and I did not want to waste my time doing another To-Do app. Here is how I solved this problem:

1. Identify what you want to learn. What technologies/frameworks/languages interest you the most?
2. Find the most starred projects of the relevant topics on Github.
3. Once you have found a project, follow the Quickstart guide. As you are following the guide, get really curious, for every step you take and every line of code you read, ask yourself, do you understand it and do you really know what it is doing? When you ask the questions, and you find the corresponding answers, you are likely to have more questions about how things work. This active learning style will help you expose and learn new concepts in a more engaging, fun and productive way.
4. Finally, once you have roughly understood how the project runs and works, why not build a mini version or a clone of it. I guarantee that you probably have not understood the concepts that you thought you have. This mini-app should have at least the core functionalities of the bigger projects you are mirroring.
5. Be curious, keep exploring, solving issues and contributing back to the project that you were first interested in.

The [Open Source Guide](https://opensource.guide/) website provides great advice and insights for anyone who is trying to get involved and contribute to the community.

## Social media presence

(Give a quote from the book Soft Skills, why self-marketing is important)

I have not paid much attention to self-marketing until I came across the best-selling book "Soft Skills: The Software Developer's Life Manual," where it devotes a whole chapter for self-marketing.

> Talent alone will only take you so far in life... The better marketing you have, the more it magnifies your talent.

Also, it talks about at some point in the career; maybe in ten years time, most will reach the skill levels of the top developers where it becomes really difficult to advance. But by marketing yourself well, more people will recognise you as the experts in the field rather than other developers because people don't even know they exist! However, it is not just about self-promotion; marketing is about:

> connecting people who want what you have to offer with you.

So you have to think about what value you can provide for others and how you may help them. Here are my plans for how I can provide values on the respective social media platforms.

I am no social media experts, and below is just my thoughts from reading the book "Soft Skill".

- Blog

I am grateful that you have read this far; in fact, I cannot be happier that you decided to start reading this post. This means what I offer in my blog can be beneficial and helpful to others. In my blog, I share the technical questions/challenges that I could not easily solve at the time, and self-reflections from life/career, an example of that is this post.

- LinkedIn

The go-to social media platform for social media. Here is where you connect with people in similar fields, professions or anyone valuable in your career network. In my opinion, there are the following categories of what people post and share on LinkedIn:

1. **Success/failure stories** of themselves or others. When people share success story like graduating, getting the first job, getting a promotion, winning an award, and on the contrary, the failures like unable to get a job despite months of applications and imposter syndrome in the workforce etc., there are a great number of reactions. My first LinkedIn post was me getting the first internship through completing a competition. I had just under 100 connections then, but I had more than 40 reactions and 2k views.
2. **Updates in the profession**. Are there any new government policy or restriction on technology? What new technologies are people adopting? Any news worth-noting in general?
3. **Self-development advice**. Stories, tips, advice on how to improve yourself socially, mentally, physically or in career.

There are definitely many other things, but generally, the type of content is quite professional, and you don't see any fun and chilled posts like a joke or a meme around.

- Twitter

I am from New Zealand. I can say Twitter is probably the least popular social media platform amongst the main ones. However, I still would like to use it because many top software engineers regularly use it, i.e. they tweet one to three times every one to two days. This platform is relatively new to me, and I am still observing what sort of content people like to post on it. My conclusion so far is the content is rather random, and it does not have a pattern, for example, a software engineer will tweet about their experience in comic con, their opinions on politics, their cats and dogs or memes. Frankly, these are the exact topics that I have no interests in talking about. At the moment, I am using Twitter as a platform to reach out to other interesting bloggers that talk about software and technology. When I came across an insightful article, in my tweet, I will ask the author questions if I had any. Otherwise, I will talk about my takeaways from the article, mention the author and share the link in the tweet.

# Closing words

2020 had been a tough year for everyone due to the pandemic. It affected every aspect of people's lives, be it a career, schooling, social life etc. Nonetheless, I am glad that I experienced failures. It helped me to find my blind spots, my weaknesses and give me more clear directions on where I want to head towards in my career and life. Had I been successful this year without the many failures, I would instead drown in self-satisfaction and celebration. Progress and improvement will be very slow. I hope you take failures as an opportunity to reflect and act on it. But of course, it is fine to feel upset or sad when you fail, but don't stop there and accept the failure, see it as an opportunity to make yourself better and stronger.
