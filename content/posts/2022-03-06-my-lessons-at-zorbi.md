  There are many lessons I have learnt at Zorbi as the founding software
  engineer. An example lesson is the company must put as much if not more
  emphasis on product management than engineering, especially in the early
  stages. I will write about the lessons with specific examples in this article.

Thinking like an engineer sometimes has its pitfalls. I spend most of my time programming, which means I have fewer opportunities to develop other vital skills such as product management and building customer relations etc. Soon after I joined Zorbi, it became apparent that I couldn't contribute as much as I wanted because those significant skills were not well developed. However, I determined to improve those skills. Below is the list of lessons I have learnt from challenging myself to think outside the software engineer's box (p.s. the lessons are in any particular order).

## The engineering effort can go to waste if the product direction is wrong

"Let's implement that auth and task management system by the end of this week, and we should be ready to launch with our first customer next week," our team established and agreed on a sprint goal for a hackathon project. However, we quickly had to shift focus and change our goal.

We met with our first customer to discuss what to expect two days before launch. The conclusion was the customer needed a different solution than ours. In other words, what we were building didn't solve their problem. Our engineering effort created no impact because we were making the wrong tool.

We shifted our focus to doing problem discovery and customer interviews so we can understand what is the job our tool can help customers achieve and what problem does it solve for them. I will elaborate more about the importance of talking to customers and product management in the next two lessons.

## Talking to customers every week helps hugely for setting the product direction

- Quote Sukhans

## Understand when to sacrifice code quality for faster product iteration

- "Code quality does not matter if the startup dies"

## Written and verbal communication are equally as important

- As an engineer, I didn't focus too much on improving my communication skills and that was a poor choice on my behalf.

## Being too polite to customers can make you seem awkward and less confident

Building from the last point, I sucked at talking to customers in the beginning. If you read the first 10 or 20 messages I sent in the Zorbi Discord channel, you would think I was a bot. I put the customers on a pedestal and I was saying "thank you" or apologies every 2 sentences. Here is a reply I wrote to a person who requested us to remove their account:

```
Thank you for the reply, I completely understand. We will see if we can fix the upload limit, too. 

Still early morning over here, so we will let you know once we have removed your account. Again, thank you for using Zorbi, and we hope you will be back one day ðŸ˜ƒ !
```

The team gave me feedback on my tone of messaging. They said it was unnatural and I sounded robotic, awkward and submissive. As a result, not many people would react or reply to my messages. I felt upset about the feedback at the time because I was just trying to be nice and polite. In hindsight, I agreed with what they said. Because after I changed my tone of messaging, I felt more natural and more confident.

To illustrate the difference, here is a reply I would've wrote to the same person who requested to remove their Zorbi account:

```
Sure, we'll let you know when your account is removed. We'd also love to learn more about why you are leaving Zorbi. Feel free to share it here, or we can chat in DMs.
```

I am not saying you shouldn't say thank you or apologize to your customers. In fact, you absolutely should when appropriate. My problem was I overused "thank you" and apologies, thus I sounded less confident and people were less inclined to talk to me. One helpful advice the team gave me was, talk to your customers the way you would to your friends.
