## Why SQS And SNS?

Describe what they are and what are their use cases and how they stand out.

## Alternatives

Talk about another blog post that I will write for technology comparisons.

## Setting Up SQS And SNS From The AWS Console

## Coming Next

In the next part of the series, I will explain with Golang, how to programatically send and receive message in a real-world scenario where you want to receive the message from SQS in a long-running server.

Thanks for reading and see you next time.
