  SQS and SNS are commonly used together to make a robust one-to-many messaging
  system. This is the first post of the two-part series for setting up and using
  SQS and SNS in Golang.

## Prerequisites

* An AWS account.
* An access key and a secret key for AWS.
* Golang. If you don't have it installed, follow the instructions [here](https://golang.org/doc/install).

## Why SQS and SNS?

SQS stands for Simple Queue Service - a proprietary service implemented by AWS. In the programming context, a queue is something that you can push the data to and you can also poll messages from it one by one. For example, let's say Ken left a review for product on an e-commerce website. The app may possibly do the following things behind the scenes. Firstly, it creates an review for this product in the database. Secondly, the app notifies the seller via email that someone has left a review for them. Optionally, if this is the first review Ken has made in his account, the app creates a badge for him and notifies him via web push notification about the badge. As you can see, there are 4 possible actions the backend will proceed from one action in the client-side.

In the above scenario, **resiliency** of the app is a concern because if one action fails, the app will not perform the following operations. You may say, why don't you just retry the request from the client-side. This could also be problematic because that means in the backend, we need to check if a review by Ken for this product has already been created, if so, then we need to check if the email has been sent to the seller and so on and so forth. Our code can get messy quite quickly easily.

This is where a queue comes to rescue. Instead of executing all actions at once, the app can push a message such as `{ event: "finsh_product_review", body: { productId: 4, reviewerId: 10 } }` to the queue, and the other service will start processing after polling the message. After the other service receive the `finish_product_review` event, the service can notify the seller about the review. A queue offers **resiliency** because it guarantees delivery of messages. Generally, a service deletes the message from the queue after a successful operation which is notifying the seller about the review in this case. However, if the service fails to process the message, then the service will continue to process the it until one of the following situation happens, as you can see from the [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/operatorguide/sqs-retries.html):

> 1. The message is processed without any error from the function, and the service deletes the message from the queue.
> 1. The Message retention period is reached and SQS deletes the message from the queue.
> 1. There is a dead-letter queue (DLQ) configured and SQS sends the message to this queue. Itâ€™s best practice to enable a DLQ on an SQS queue to prevent any message loss.

SNS stands for Simple Notification Service, it is a pub/sub messaging service where the publisher can be any service and the subscriber can range from email, SMS, lambda and SQS etc.

Now let's take a look at why we choose to couple SQS and SNS together. I have adapted some great points from [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13681213/what-is-the-difference-between-amazon-sns-and-amazon-sqs) awesome StackOverflow article.

Why would someone choose to combine SNS and SQS, i.e. why not use SQS alone or SNS alone?

Talk about what SQS and SNS are good at individually. What functionalities does SNS satisfy that SQS cannot do? And what problems does coupling SQS and SNS solve, i.e. what problems may you have if you only use SNS for example (refers to the rate at which you app or service receives the messages)? Conclude by saying coupling SQS and SNS together brings the benefits of both worlds.

## Alternatives

Talk about another blog post that I will write for technology comparisons.

## Setting up SNS from the console

As mentioned above, SNS has a concept of topics where the publisher pushes the message to a topic. Then, the respective subscribers receive the messages from SNS. Let's see how to create an SNS topic.

Go to the AWS SNS page -> Click **Topics** from the left-side panel -> Click **Create topic**

![aws-sns-page](/media/aws-sns-topics-page.png)

1. Choose the **standard** type.
2. Name the topic **ProductPriceTopicDev**.
3. Name the display name **Product Price Topic Development**.
4. Leave the rest of the options as they are and click **Create topic**.

Next, we will create a subscriber for the topic, a standard SQS queue in our case.

## Setting up SQS from the console

SQS is not the only subscriber that SNS can publish a message. For example, the valid subscriber endpoints are HTTP/HTTPS, Email/Email-JSON, and AWS Lambda etc., as you can see from the official doc [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-create-subscribe-endpoint-to-topic.html). As mentioned above, the benefits of using SQS as a subscriber are the following:

1. Guarantee message delivery.
2. You can use a dead-letter queue to debug failed sent messages.
3. The application can poll and process the messages from SQS at its rate. If we choose not to use SQS, then SNS may push messages directly to the applications at the rate they could not handle.
4. Follow up on the point above. Since both SNS and SQS scales definitely, the combination of these technologies will be the building blocks of a scalable, performant and reliable architecture.

Here are the steps to **create a standard SQS queue**:

Go to the AWS SQS page -> Click **Create queue** -> Name the queue **ProductPriceUdpateQueueDev** -> Leave the rest of options as they are and click **Create queue**

## Caveats

Notice how the topic **ProductPriceTopicDev** and **ProductPriceUdpateQueueDev** we created was the standard type. The topic and the queue can also be FIFO. Only a FIFO queue can subscribe to a FIFO topic.

- We will use the combination of the FIFO topic and FIFO queue in the case where the order of the arrival of the messages matters. For example, for an application where the users can claim a limited prize or purchase a limited product, the "First In First Serve" principle applies to both situations. Therefore, a FIFO topic and a FIFO queue are suitable to use here.

- Talk about my naming convention of the topic and the queue. e.g. A granular topic name and a granular queue name vs a granular topic name and multiple queues vs multiple topics and multiple queues; what are the tradeoffs of each approach.

## What's next

In the next part of the series, I will explain using Golang; how to programmatically send and receive a message in a real-world scenario, where you want to receive the message from SQS in a long-running server.

Thanks for reading and see you next time.
