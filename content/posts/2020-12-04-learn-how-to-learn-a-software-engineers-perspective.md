description: Learning is quintessential, and it has become essential and it is
  more important than ever before. Yet I have had a countless number of
  unproductive "learning" hours. This post is a reflection of what did not work
  for me and what I find is the best way to learn.

Software is adaptive, evolving, at an incredible astounding pace. We, as software engineers, have to keep up to speed and date with best practices, industry-standard or up-and-coming technologies. The popular [backend development roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/backend) gives an overview of what there is to learn; I was a little terrified by the amount of knowledge on the roadmap.

# What learning methods are inefficient for me

- **Read without purpose**. Reading is one of the most important things; I believe this is a statement many have come across. However, there should be a follow-up after it which is to read smartly, read with a purpose and read to understand. You should pause here and think, why are you reading this, what do you want to achieve and what is the goal? Do you agree or disagree with what I am saying?

  I have been a victim of reading a book, a blog or a tutorial just because other people said to do so; I found that when I am just purely reading, I almost attain no information other than a brief idea of what the content is. But I continue to go through the motions and repeat the same mistakes because people said reading is so essential. Be aware. I am not saying that reading is not necessary. I am suggesting passive reading, i.e. reading with no intent or purpose is a time not wisely spent because you end up learning tiny things.

- **Follow tutorials with no questions.** I have done this often, I find a post with the solution, and I blindly follow each step, then I magically finish the problem. Only three days later, I found myself back to the same tutorial/post again. Why does this happen? I think it is because when I only follow the instructions, I will not understand the concepts. Without knowing the underlying reasons why things work, I am doomed to search for the answer to the same problem instead of having the ability to solve it on my own.

- **Watching and listening to videos.** Out of all the possible ways of learning, if you are only doing it by going through the motion, then videos are perhaps the least productive way. It is a type of content that is the easiest to consume, and because of that, it requires no immediate actions and active thinking on your behalf, so you end up retaining very little information at the end.

# What learning methods are working for me

Before I dive into the methods that are working for me, I would love to point out that there is a commonality in the inefficient learning methods I have described above, they are all passive. Without active engagement, I find it very difficult to retain the information. And here are the methods that I find the most useful, ironically, the points I will describe below are modified versions of the inefficient techniques I have described above. If done right, reading, following tutorials and watch videos are one of the best ways to learn. Hence the goal is to obtain the maximal amount of information.

- **Identify a technology/topic/library** or the thing that I want to learn. This step sounds stupidly simple, but it helps set the direction I want to go and to focus on it.

- After _setting the direction_, for example, if I want to learn about Jenkins CI/CD pipeline, I will first **follow the quick start guide** to wrap my head around it. Then I will try **integrate it with my current project/work**. Then I will want to _learn_ about the **best practices**. Usually, the official documentation will contain a section for that. In general, they will have a lot of tips, what works best for me is integrating it slowly in the project. e.g. integrate one relevant best practice tip into the project is satisfactory. Whenever I try to do too much, such as applying ten or fifteen tips all at once, I would end up using none.

- During the process of getting started on the new technology and integrating it to my current work or project, there will be many **challenges and problems**, and that is one of the _best opportunities_ for learning. When I start searching for answers or solution of a particular issue, my brain is engaged and focused, so I pay more attention to the words I read and listen. Notice the difference, here I am reading with a purpose and a goal in my, that is, I want to find the necessary information that can solve my problem. To do that, I first have to understand the problem I have, that often consists of more than half of the process.

- (Extra step) Read about what is happening under the hood from the official doc or a book. When I know how to come up with a workable example, and I understand why it works, a.k.a the theory behind it, I will retain this information for a long time. However, under most circumstances, after the previous few steps, my brain usually cannot accomplish this anymore. I have to take a day of a break at least before I dive deep into the theoretical concepts. Hence this step is the next level.

The points above are general for learning most topics. Below, I have broken it into three main parts where I will provide examples specific to.

## Learning theories

Thinking back to school, be it high school or university, the knowledge that you learn is mostly theoretical. I dreaded learning those, but I have learnt an excellent strategy for learning theory from school. While I was reflecting recently about my study and school life, I was thinking, why was I most productive during exam times, what was the strategies that I used and are there any other reasons that enabled max productivity? Here are the takeaways and thoughts:

First, the external factors are very important, e.g. the time pressure, the pressure you put on yourself to perform, to get a good grade or to pass. In the short-term, which is the time I will have to prepare for the exam, these extrinsic motivations push me to learn harder. Next, I will go into some hands-on strategies:

- **Read and roughly understand the concept**. Don't spend too much time here; I don't understand the concepts unless I know how to apply it, so read to the extent that you understand the idea and you know how it works, which leads to the next step.

- **Find and solve problems**, lots of problems. Mathematics is a prime example; I will have no luck knowing how to do integration by parts if I only read, I will have to keep solving problems until I become accustomed and used to the concept. However, only solving problems does you no good neither, you need to get into the feedback loop and cycle, continuous improvement speeds up knowledge
  retention.

- **Get into the feedback cycle** by - 1. search for the answer yourself online, from the coursebook or other available resources. 2. get into a discussion with other people who may know the answers, reaching out only for the answers helps. Still, the knowledge exchange and the active group discussion fosters better learning. 3. post the question on the relevant forum or ask the lecturer for help when all luck runs out.

- **Keep going** until the concept entirely becomes autonomous and then you can find the new thing that you would love to learn by using the same steps above.

## Learning practical stuff

A great example here will be learning how to build a navigation bar using HTML+CSS; it is visual and practical. Funnily enough, to learn this, first, one needs to understand what flexbox layout and flex item alignment are in CSS and the ideas of containers and children in HTML. As you can see, no matter if you are learning theory or if you are learning the practical stuff, you will end up learning the integration of both at the end.

- First step is to **try it out and see for yourself**. Generally, if the concept is not advanced, a tutorial or a brief get started guide will help you solve the problem. However, if what you are trying to accomplish is quite advanced, it usually will be hard-pressed to find a practical example online. Therefore you will have to put the pieces together with past knowledge and read up about the relevant concept on a book. The inference of unfamiliar concepts using experience is a testimony for whether you truly grasp the idea.

- Once I get started with an initial example, then I will go back and dissect the pieces that I do not understand. I will urge myself to get to learn the theory behind it. Here we are reversing the step from the section above. Instead of finding a theory to learn, then do the practicals, here we have a practical example, and we want to know the ideas behind it.

# Obstacles and possible solutions

Here are the obstacles I have on the learning journey and the corresponding methods I think may help:

- **Lack of motivation or unproductive when learning a large topic/concept**. Recently, I tried to consolidate my understanding of the SOLID principles and excellent coding practices by reading the book, _Adaptive Code via C#_. I struggled. Because how technical the book is and the vast amount of technical terminologies I have to get myself used to. To sum up, I was attempting to eat a whole elephant in one bite. Hence I became frustrated and unmotivated because of my inability to understand how it works. So a solution I have is problem decomposition and apply abstraction to the concept. In other words, take it easy and slowly, break it down into smaller concepts, for example, instead of wanting to learn the SOLID principle, say I want to know the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP). A step further will be, I want to know the decorator pattern and understand why follows the SRP.

- **Moving on and giving up too soon**. When I decide to learn something new or start on a new project, I get quite passionate at the start; then I lose interest in it relatively quickly. Partially, I think it is because there is not an extrinsic motivation for it. Sure, the internal reason is fundamental, but when you have a full-time job, social life, cooking, and exercising and multiple things that you may want to do. The drive you have to learn can only take you so far; The real-life responsibilities and the tasks will overtake and bury the willingness to learn and acquire new things. Next time when I try to learn something new, to help me stay on track and continue learning it in the long term; I will state why I want to learn it.

  Please continue with the point above, when I am learning new technology. Unless I am learning it purely to explore, I think what helps me to stick with learning it long term is choosing and picking a technology that is relevant to what I am doing and the project I have at the moment. A counterexample of that is, I made an effort to contribute to Atlassian's `gostatsd`, I roughly understand how Golang works, but I have never used it in any of the projects. I was super passionate about it in the first few weeks, but work was piling up, and on a side note; I was developing a React application with Express server, so Golang and `gostatsd` were not relevant to me at the time. I feel bad. I have not looked into the repository for a while now. However, I am also glad that I took the time to reflect because now I understand better why that is happening, and hopefully, I can make adjustments next time and keep going strong.

# Summary

Being patient, resilient, and strategic is one of the most critical factors to help foster continuous productive learning. In the combination of internal drive, the passion for learning and knowing the purpose or the goals behind it, it is a big motivation, and it helps you to focus and concentrate so that you do not give up halfway through. I hope you and I adopt the strategies or maybe use whatever works so we can all benefit from it.
